<Heading>The Data Structures</Heading>

This chapter describes all the data structures used in this package. We
start with a section on finite fields and what is already there in the
&GAP; kernel and library. Then we describe compressed vectors, large
scalars and compressed matrices.

<Section Label="finfields">
<Heading>Finite field elements</Heading>

Throughout the package, elements in the field <M>GF(p)</M> of <M>p</M>
elements are represented by numbers <M>0,1,\ldots,p-1</M> and arithmetic
is just the standard arithmetic in the integers modulo <M>p</M>.<P/>

Bigger finite fields are done by calculating in the polynomial ring
<M>GF(p)[x]</M> in one indeterminate <M>x</M> modulo a certain irreducible
polynomial. By convention, we use the so-called <Q>Conway polynomials</Q>
(see
<URL>http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de:8001/~Frank.Luebeck/data/ConwayPol/index.html</URL>) 
for this purpose, because they provide a standard way of embedding finite
fields into their extension fields. Because Conway polynomials are monic, 
we can store coset representatives by storing polynomials of degree less
than <M>d</M>, where <M>d</M> is the degree of the finite field over its
prime field.<P/>

As of this writing, &GAP; has another implementation of finite field
elements built into its kernel, which stores finite field elements by
storing the discrete logarithm with respect to a primitive root of the
field. Although this is nice and efficient for small finite fields, it
becomes unhandy for larger finite fields, because one needs a lookup table of
length <M>p^d</M> for doing efficient addition. The &GAP; implementation
thus is limited to fields with less than or equal to <M>65536</M> elements.
<P/>

For those finite fields implemented in &GAP; we use those elements as
scalars for our vectors. Conversion between the internal format used in
the compressed vectors and the &GAP; representation is done via table
lookup. For larger finite fields, this package provides
an implementation that uses the above mentioned approach with polynomial
arithmetic. See Section <Ref Sect="cscas"/> for details.<P/>

<Section Label="cvecs">
<Heading>Compressed Vectors in Memory</Heading>

<Subsection>
<Heading>Packing of prime field elements</Heading>

For this section, we assume that the base field is <M>GF(p^d)</M>, the
finite field with <M>p^d</M> elements, where <M>p</M> is a prime and
<M>d</M> is a positive integer. This is realized as a field extension
of degree <M>d</M> over the prime field <M>GF(p)</M> using the Conway
polynomial <M>c \in GF(p)[x]</M>. We always represent field elements
of <M>GF(p^d)</M> by polynomials
<Math>a = \sum_{i=0}^{d-1} a_i x^i</Math>
where the coefficients <M>a_i</M> are in <M>GF(p)</M>. Because <M>c</M>
is monic, this gives a one-to-one correspondance between polynomials
and finite field elements.<P/>

The memory layout for compressed vectors is determined by two important
constants, depending only on <M>p</M> and the word length of the
machine. The word length is 4 bytes on 32bit machines (for example
on the i386 architecture) and 8 bytes on 64bit machines (for example
on the AMD64 architecture). More concretely, a <Q><C>Word</C></Q> is an
<C>unsigned long int</C> in C and the length of a <C>Word</C> is 
<C>sizeof(unsigned long int)</C>.<P/>

Those constants are <C>bitsperel</C> (bits per prime field element)
and <C>elsperword</C> (prime field elements per <C>Word</C>).
<C>bitsperel</C> is <M>1</M> for <M>p=2</M> and otherwise the smallest
integer, such that <M>2^bitsperel > 2\cdot p-1</M>. This means, that
we can store the numbers from <M>0</M> to <M>2\cdot p - 1</M> in
<C>bitsperel</C> bits. <C>elsperword</C> is <M>32/bitsperel</M> rounded
down to the next integer and multiplied by <M>2</M> if the length of a
<C>Word</C> is <M>8</M>. Note that we thus store as many prime field
elements as possible into one <C>Word</C>, however, on 64bit machines
we store only twice as much as would fit into 32bit, even if we could
pack one more into a <C>Word</C>. This has technical reasons to make
conversion between different architectures more efficient.<P/>

These definitions imply that we can put <C>elsperword</C> prime field
elements into one <C>Word</C>. We do this by using the <C>bitsperel</C>
least significant bits in the <C>Word</C> for the first prime field
element, using the next <C>bitsperel</C> bits for the next prime field
element and so on. Here is an example that shows how the <M>6</M> finite
field elements <M>0,1,2,3,4,5</M> of <M>GF(11)</M> are stored in that
order in one 32bit <C>Word</C>.
<C>bitsperel</C> is here <M>4</M>, because 
<M>2^4 &lt; 2\cdot 11 - 1 = 21 &lt; 2^5</M>. Therefore <C>elsperword</C>
is <M>6</M> on a 32bit machine.

<Example>
 most significant xx|.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|..... least significant
                  00|00101|00100|00011|00010|00001|00000 
                    |    5|    4|    3|    2|    1|    0
</Example>

Here is another example that shows how the <M>20</M> finite field elements
<M>0,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,0,1,2,2,1,0,2,2</M> of <M>GF(3)</M> are stored 
in that order in one 64bit <C>Word</C>. 
<C>bitsperel</C> is here <M>3</M>, because 
<M>2^2 &lt; 2\cdot 3 - 1 = 5 &lt; 2^3</M>. Therefore <C>elsperword</C>
is <M>20</M> on a 32bit machine. Remember, that we only put twice as 
many elements in one 64bit <C>Word</C> than we could in one 32bit
<C>Word</C>!

<Example>
 xxxx..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!..!
 0000010010000001010010001000010010010001001001000000000010001000
       2  2  0  1  2  2  1  0  2  2  2  1  1  1  0  0  0  2  1  0
</Example>

(The exclamation marks mark the right hand side of the prime field
elements.)<P/>

Note that different architectures store their <C>Word</C>s in a
different byte order in memory (<Q>endianess</Q>). We do <E>not</E>
specify how the data is distributed into bytes here! All access is via
<C>Word</C>s and their arithmetic (shifting, addition, multiplication,
etc.). See Section <Ref Sect="extrep"/> for a discussion of this with
respect to our external representation.<P/>

</Subsection>

<Subsection>
<Heading>Extension Fields</Heading>

Now that we have seen how prime field elements are packed into
<C>Word</C>s, we proceed to the description how compressed vectors are
stored over arbitrary extension fields:<P/>

Assume a compressed vector has length <M>l</M> with <M>l \geq 0</M>. If
<M>d=1</M> (prime field), it just uses <M>elsperword/l</M> <C>Word</C>s
(division rounded up to the next integer), where the first <C>Word</C>
stores the leftmost <C>elsperword</C> field elements in the first
<C>Word</C> as described above and so on. This means, that the very
first field element is stored in the least significant bits of the first
<C>Word</C>. <P/>

In the extension field case <M>GF(p^d)</M>, a vector of length <M>l</M>
uses <M>(elsperword/l)*d</M> <C>Word</C>s (division rounded up to the next
integer), where the first <M>d</M> <C>Word</C>s store the leftmost
<C>elsperword</C> field elements. The very first word stores all the
constant coefficients of the polynomials representing the first
<C>elsperword</C> field elements in their order from left to right,
the second <C>Word</C> stores the coefficients of <M>x^1</M> and so 
on until the <M>d</M>'th <C>Word</C>, which stores the coefficients
of <M>x^{d-1}</M>. Unused entries behind the end of the actual vector
data within the last <C>Word</C> has to be zero!.<P/>

The following example shows, how the <M>9</M> field elements
<M>x^2+x+1</M>, <M>x^2+2x+2</M>, <M>x^2+3x+3</M>, <M>x^2+4x+4</M>, 
<M>2x^2+x</M>, <M>2x^2+3x+1</M>, <M>2x^2+4x+2</M>, <M>3x^2+1</M>,
and <M>4x^2+x+3</M> of <M>GF(5^3)</M> occurring in a vector of length 
<M>9</M> in that order are stored on a 32bit machine:

<Example>
 ^^^ lower memory addresses ^^^
            ....|....|....|....|....|....|....|....  (least significant bit)
 1st Word:  0001|0010|0001|0000|0100|0011|0010|0001| (first
 2nd Word:  0000|0100|0011|0001|0100|0011|0010|0001|     8 field
 3rd Word:  0011|0010|0010|0010|0001|0001|0001|0001|        elements)

 VVV higher memory addresses VVV
</Example>

A <Q><C>cvec</C></Q> (one of our compressed vectors) is a &GAP; 
<Q>Data object</Q> (that is with <C>TNUM</C> equal to <C>T&uscore;DATOBJ</C>). 
The first machine word in its bag is a pointer to its type, from the second
machine word on the <C>Word</C>s containing the above data are stored.
The bag is exactly long enough to hold the type pointer and the data
<C>Word</C>s.<P/>

</Subsection>

<Subsection>
<Heading>How is information about the base field stored?</Heading>

But how does the system know, over which field the vector is and how long 
it is? The type of a &GAP; object consists of <M>3</M> pieces: A family, 
a bit list (for the filters), and one &GAP; object for <Q>defining
data</Q>. The additional information about the vector is stored in the
third piece, the defining data, and is called a <Q><C>cvecclass</C></Q>.<P/>

A <C>cvecclass</C> is a positional object with <M>5</M>
components:

In position 5 we have just the &GAP; finite field object <C>GF(p,d)</C> for

(see Section <Ref Sect="cscas"/>) otherwise.<P/>

The field is described by the &GAP; object in position 1, a so-called
<C>fieldinfo</C> object, which is described in the following table:

Note that &GAP; has a family for all finite field elements of a given
characteristic <M>p</M>, vectors over a finite field are then in the
collections family of that family and matrices are in the collections
family of the collections family of the scalars family. We use the same
families in the same way for compressed vectors and matrices for fields
with less than or equal to <M>65536</M> elements. For larger finite fields,
we create a new family for each field (see Section <Ref
Sect="cscas"/>).<P/>

<Subsection>
<Heading>Limits that follow from the Data Format</Heading>

The following limits come from the above mentioned data format or other
internal restrictions (an
<Q>immediate integer</Q> in &GAP; can take values between <M>2^{-28}</M>
and <M>(2^{28})-1</M> inclusively on 32bit machines and between
<M>2^{-60}</M> and <M>(2^{60})-1</M> on 64bit machines):

<List>
<Item> The prime <M>p</M> must be an immediate integer. </Item>
<Item> The degree <M>d</M> must be smaller than <M>1024</M> (this limit
is arbitrarily chosen at the moment and could be increased easily).</Item>

<Item> The length of a vector must be an immediate integer. </Item>
</List>

</Subsection>

<Section Label="cscas">
<Heading>Large Scalars</Heading>

Large scalars (<C>csca</C>s) are internally represented nearly as
vectors of length <M>1</M>. That is, they are &GAP; data objects
containing a pointer to their type and <M>d</M> <C>Word</C>s containing
the coefficients of the representing polynomial, starting with the
constant coefficient. The coefficients are stored in the least
significant bits of the <C>Word</C>s, as would the coefficients of a
vector of length <M>1</M>. <P/>

Note that this is not very memory efficient for large extensions
in small characteristic, because every prime field element uses a
<C>Word</C>. For such cases one would better use another data format.<P/>

The type of a large scalar has as its <Q>defining data</Q> a so-called
<C>cscaclass</C>, which is similar to a <C>cvecclass</C>
(see Section <Ref Sect="cvecs"/>). However, the length field contains
the value <M>-1</M> and from position 5 on there are differences.

<Heading>Compressed Matrices</Heading>

The implementation of <C>cmats</C> (compressed matrices) is done mainly
on the &GAP; level without using too many C parts. Only the time critical parts
for some operations for matrices are done in the kernel.<P/>

A <C>cmat</C> object is a positional object with at least the following 
components:

<Table Align="ll">

The <C>cvecclass</C> in the component <C>vecclass</C> determines the
number of columns of the matrix by the length of the rows.<P/>

The length of the list in component <C>rows</C> is
<C>len+1</C>, because the first position is unbound such that the type
of the list <C>rows</C> can always be computed efficiently. The
rows are then stored in positions 2 to <C>len+1</C>.<P/>

The component <C>greasehint</C> contains the greasing level 
for the next matrix multiplication, in which this matrix occurs as the 
factor on the right hand side (if greasing is worth the effort, see
Section <Ref Sect="grease"/>).<P/>

A <C>cmat</C> can be <Q>pre-greased</Q>, which just means, that a certain
number of linear combinations of its rows is already precomputed (see
Section <Ref Sect="grease"/>). In that case, the object is in the

<Heading>External Representation of Matrices on Storage</Heading>

<Subsection>
<Heading>Byte ordering and word length</Heading>

This section describes the external representation of matrices. A special
data format is needed here, because of differences between computer
architectures with respect to word length (32bit/64bit) and endianess.
The term <Q>endianess</Q> refers to the fact, that different architectures
store their long words in a different way in memory, namely they order the
bytes that together make up a long word in different orders.<P/>

The external representation is the same as the internal format of
a 32bit machine with little endianess, which means, that the lower
significant bytes of a <C>Word</C> are stored in lower addresses. The
reasons for this decision are firstly that 64bit machines can do the bit
shifting to convert between internal and externel representation easier
using their wide registers, and secondly, that the nowadays most popular
architectures i386 and AMD64 use both little endianess, such that
conversion is only necessary on a minority of machines.<P/>
</Subsection>

<Subsection>
<Heading>The header of a <C>cmat</C> file</Heading>

The header of a <C>cmat</C> file consists of 5 words of 64bit each, that
are stored in little endian byte order:

<Table Align="l">
<Caption>Header of a <C>cmat</C> file</Caption>
<Row>
<Item>the magic value <Q><C>GAPCMat1</C></Q> as ASCII letters (8 bytes) in this
order</Item>
</Row>
<Row>
<Item>the value of <M>p</M> to describe the base field</Item>
</Row>
<Row>
<Item>the value of <M>d</M> to describe the base field</Item>
</Row>
<Row>
<Item>the number of rows of the matrix</Item>
</Row>
<Row>
<Item>the number of columns of the matrix</Item>
</Row>
</Table>

After these <M>40</M> bytes follow the data words as described above
using little endian 32bit <C>Word</C>s as in the internal representation
on 32bit machines.<P/>

Note that the decision to put not more than twice as many prime field
elements into a 64bit <C>Word</C> than would fit into a 32bit <C>Word</C>
makes the conversion between internal and external representation much
easier to implement.
