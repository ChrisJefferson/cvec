This  chapter describes  the  functions defined  in  the &GAP;4  package
<Package>cvec</Package>.  

By   default  the   <Package>cvec</Package>   is  not automatically   loaded
by   &GAP;   when   it   is  installed.   You  must   load  the   package
with   <C>LoadPackage("cvec");</C>   before  its   functions   become
available.<P/>

Please,            send             me            an            e-mail
(<Email>max.neunhoeffer@math.rwth-aachen.de</Email>)  if  you  have  any
questions,  remarks, suggestions,  etc. concerning  this package.
Also, I would like to hear about applications of this package.<P/>

<Section Label="Sect-Install">
<Heading>Installation of the <Package>cvec</Package>-package</Heading>

To install this  package (after extracting the packages  archive file to
the  GAP  <F>pkg</F>  directory)  go to  the  directory  <F>cvec</F>  (the
directory containing this README file) and call<P/>

<C>./configure [path]</C><P/>

where <C>path</C>  is a path  to  the main <Package>GAP</Package> root
directory (if not given, the default <F>../..</F> is assumed). <P/>

Afterwards call <C>make</C>  to  compile  a binary file. <P/>

If you  installed GAP on several  architectures, you must execute this
<C>configure/make</C> step  on each  of the architectures  immediately
after configuring GAP itself on this architecture. <P/>

The package will  not  work  without this step.<P/>

The <F>INSTALL</F>  in the main  package directory also explains  how to
compile the kernel function into a static module.

You  can  also  run  a test of    the installation  by  typing <C>make
test</C>.
