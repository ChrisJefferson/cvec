<Chapter Label="install">
<Heading>Installation of the <Package>cvec</Package>-Package</Heading>
<Index><Package>cvec</Package></Index>

To install this  package (after extracting the packages  archive file to
the  GAP  <F>pkg</F>  directory)  go to  the  directory  <F>cvec</F>  (the
directory containing this README file) and call<P/>

<Log>./configure [path]</Log>

where <C>path</C>  is a path  to  the main <Package>GAP</Package> root
directory (if not given, the default <F>../..</F> is assumed). <P/>

Afterwards call <P/>

<Log>make</Log>

to  compile  a binary file. <P/>

If you  installed GAP on several  architectures, you must execute this
<C>configure/make</C> step  on each  of the architectures  immediately
after configuring GAP itself on this architecture. <P/>

The package will  not  work  without this step.<P/>

The <F>README</F> file in the main  package directory also explains  how to
compile the kernel function into a static module.<P/>

By   default  the   <Package>cvec</Package>   is  not automatically   loaded
by   &GAP;   when   it   is  installed.   You  must   load  the   package
with   <C>LoadPackage("cvec");</C>   before  its   functions   become
available.<P/>

Please, send me an e-mail
(<Email>max.neunhoeffer@math.rwth-aachen.de</Email>) if you have any
questions, remarks, suggestions, etc. concerning this package. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.<P/>
