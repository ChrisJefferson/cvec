     README file for the `CVEC' GAP4 package (Max Neunhoeffer)
     =========================================================
        
To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download one of the
archive files
    cvec-x.x.tar.gz
    cvec-x.x.zoo
    cvec-x.x.tar.bz2
    cvec-x.x.zip
and unpack it using 
    gunzip cvec-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf cvec-x.x.tar
respectively
    unzoo -x cvec-x.x.zoo
and so on.

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `cvec'.

To install this package do

    cd cvec
    ./configure
    make

If you installed the package in another "pkg" directory than the
standard "pkg" directory in your GAP4 installation, then you have to
do two things. Firstly during compilation you have to use the option
"--with-gaproot=PATH" of the "configure" script where "PATH" is a path
to the main GAP root directory (if not given the default "../.." is
assumed).

Secondly you have to 
specify the path to the directory containing your
"pkg"
directory to GAP's list of directories. This can be done by starting
GAP with the "-l" command line option followed by the name
of the directory and a semicolon. Then your directory is prepended to
the list of directories searched. Otherwise the package is not found by
GAP. Of course, you can add this option to your GAP startup script.

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you must execute the
configure/make step for each of the architectures. You can either
do this immediately after configuring and compiling GAP itself on
this architecture, or alternatively (when using version 4.5 of GAP or
newer) set the environment variable "CONFIGNAME" to the name of the
configuration you used when compiling GAP before running "./configure".
Note however that your compiler choice and flags (environment variables
"CC" and "CFLAGS" need to be chosen to match the setup of the original
GAP compilation. For example you have to specify 32-bit or 64-bit mode
correctly!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recompiling the documentation is possible by the command `gap makedoc.g'
in the `cvec' directory. But this should not be necessary.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I
would like to hear about applications of this package.
